This module only provides basic integration to the GOV.UK Pay service. It does nothing more than configuration and methods for other modules or functionality to call.

Steps to Configure:
- Configuration
    - GOV.UK Pay
        - Active API Key -> GOV.UK Pay API Key. Used to communicate with GOV.UK Pay service.
        - Payment reference -> The Payment reference that appears on all payments once completed.
    
Once the API Key is provided, this provides the base level configuration. From here it is up to any plugins or add-on functionality to utilise the GOV.UK Pay integration to do stuff.
