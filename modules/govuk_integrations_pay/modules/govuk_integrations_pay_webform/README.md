This module provides a GOV.UK Pay Webform Element for use within Webforms. This element can be used as an GOV.UK Pay enabler for the Webform, providing a fixed value, or can utilise options within the Webform to provide a dynamic value to GOV.UK Pay.

Steps to setup:
- Go to the relevant Webform that needs to be GOV.UK Pay enabled.
- Add element -> Advanced Elements -> GOV.UK Pay
- Fields:
    - Amount Provider 
        - Defines how an amount is provided to GOV.UK Pay
        - Webform element 
            - Retrieves the value from another element. Restricted to:
                - Hidden element
                - Number element
                - Radios element
                - Radios Other element
                - Select element
                - Select Other element
                - Value element
                - Computed Token element
                - Computed Twig element
        - Static amount 
            - Provide a static amount to send to GOV.UK Pay.
    - Use default content? 
        - If ticked, utilise a set of default content to display in place of the element on the form to inform users about the redirection to GOV.UK Pay.
        - If unticked, it is expected that you will provide your own markup to explain this process.
    - GOV.UK Pay Summary
        - Text that displays on the GOV.UK Pay page once the user is sent across to GOV.UK Pay.
        - This text is restricted to 255 characters, as per GOV.UK Pay restrictions.
        - This text is also not allowed any type of special character.
    - Confirmation message
        - Markup to display to the user once they are redirected frmo GOV.UK Pay back to your site once payment has been sent.
- Once the fields are configured, save the Element and Webform.

Once added, the GOV.UK Pay element will force the Webform to redirect to GOV.UK Pay to handle the payment, as defined within the Element configuration. This will bypass default Webform handling upon submission, including emails. It is on the roadmap to invoke these handlers once the user is redirected to the Confirmation page.
